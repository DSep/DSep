### Hey, I'm Sepand! ðŸ‘‹

ðŸ”­ I'm a Computer Science and Physics student at UBC, passionate about tech, space, and building cool things! Recently, I was a full time research intern at Polytechnique MontrÃ©al, working on a robotic swarms project (think bee or ant-like autonomous coordination). Now I continue to work on this and other projects with them part time, while finishing my studies at UBC.

ðŸŒ± For two summers, I have been an SDE intern at Amazon with the Amazon Fuse team. Before that, I was an intern at the European Space Agency, specifically on the CAVES and PANGAEA team at the European Astronaut Centre.

âš¡ I'm always interested in new internships, projects and interesting discussion. Feel free to get in touch through [LinkedIn](https://linkedin.com/in/sepandd) or [my website](https://sepand.me).
