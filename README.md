### Hey, I'm Sepand! ðŸ‘‹

ðŸ”­ I'm a co-founder of a startup building software and machine learning models to enable sustainable fisheries ([OnDeck](https://ondeck.fish)). I recently finished my time as a Master's student in Computer Science at Cambridge. Overall, I'm passionate about tech, space, and working on interesting problems!

ðŸŒ± Previously, I completed my Bachelor's of Science in Computer Science at the University of British Columbia (UBC). Concurrently, I was a research intern at Polytechnique MontrÃ©al, working on a robotic swarms project (think bee or ant-like autonomous coordination). For two summers, I was also an SDE intern at Amazon with the Amazon Fuse team. Prior to that, I was an intern at the European Space Agency, specifically on the CAVES and PANGAEA team at the European Astronaut Centre.

âš¡ I'm always interested in new projects and interesting discussions. Feel free to get in touch through [LinkedIn](https://linkedin.com/in/sepandd) or [my website](https://sepand.me).
