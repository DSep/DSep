### Hey, I'm Sepand! ðŸ‘‹

ðŸ”­ I'm a Master's student in Computer Science at Cambridge, passionate about tech, space, and building cool things! I've also been using machine learning to enable more sustainable fisheries with my startup ([OnDeck](https://ondeck.fish)), and as well as other projects concurrently with my studies at Cambridge.

ðŸŒ± Previously, I completed my Bachelor's of Science in Computer Science at the University of British Columbia (UBC). Concurrently, I was a research intern at Polytechnique MontrÃ©al, working on a robotic swarms project (think bee or ant-like autonomous coordination). For two summers, I was also an SDE intern at Amazon with the Amazon Fuse team. Before that, I was an intern at the European Space Agency, specifically on the CAVES and PANGAEA team at the European Astronaut Centre.

âš¡ I'm always interested in new projects and interesting discussions. Feel free to get in touch through [LinkedIn](https://linkedin.com/in/sepandd) or [my website](https://sepand.me).
