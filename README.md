### Hey, I'm Sepand! ðŸ‘‹

ðŸ”­ I'm a Computer Science and Physics student at UBC, passionate about tech, space, and building cool things! Currently, I'm a research intern at Polytechnique MontrÃ©al, working on a robotic swarms project (think bee or ant-like autonimous coordination).

ðŸŒ± This summer, I was an SDE intern at Amazon with the Amazon Fuse team. Before that, I was an intern at the European Space Agency, specifically on the CAVES and PANGAEA team at the European Astronaut Centre.

âš¡ I'm always interested in new internships, projects and interesting discussion. Feel free to get in touch through [LinkedIn](https://linkedin.com/in/sepandd) or [my website](https://sepand.me).
